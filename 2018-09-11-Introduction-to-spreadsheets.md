Introduction to spreadsheets

6/9/18

We started the lesson off with our teacher going through what we were going to do during the lesson. We were going to be writing code. So he went on to spreadsheets and showed us what to do, at first it was a little hard but then I got the hang of it and it became easy. After the first part we went through the rest of the work and I was able to get hang of it pretty quickly. This meant I was finished first and could help my fellow classmates which meant that we were all on the same level. By the end of the lesson I had created a working code that I was able to use and had no extra work to do after the lesson.

In the lesson I think that I probably could have contributed more in the lesson because I didn't really answer the teacher's questions. For ext lesson I want to try and contribute to the lesson a bit more so that I do better as a result at the end of the lessons.
