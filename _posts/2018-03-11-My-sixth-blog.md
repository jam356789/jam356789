  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by going through each point in the activity we were doing and turning it into code and using it on python. I also referred back and forth from the sheet we were given to the piece of python code that we were using. The strategy that I found effective was trying out what we were doing and then going back through it and making sure that I had done the work right.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was that I was sitting by my own and sort of isolated from the class because my partners computer wasn't working. This meant that I could not ask my peer for help if I was stuck on one of the questions. The habit that I need to work on is reading the sheet quicker but getting all of the information so that I can spend more time working on the code than looking that the piece of code that gave me the code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is focusing on the code that I am trying to work on and trying to figure out what I can do next rather than spending about fifty percent of the time looking at the sheet we were given that contained the code. As well as that I need to be able to persevere and not have to ask the teacher what the answer is all the time.</td>
