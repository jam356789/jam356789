  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying to see what my partner had done the week before (because I was not in the lesson) and I asked for help if I was stuck or had no clue whatsoever what to do. The strategies that I found were effective was trying to do the level and then if I was completely stuck then I would either ask my peer, ask my teacher but if I neither of them were able to do it I would skip the level.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited my learning was spending too much time thinking about what I was going to in the specific level and not spending enough time on the actual level. This meant that I didn't get very far into ny work. The habit that I need to work on is definitely working through each level quicker because I am usually very slow and I am not able to do much work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that I will change for next time is spending less time on each of the individual levels so that I am able to go through more levels during the lesson which means I will be further ahead in the class. The way I will improve my learning is by not asking for help too often because it limits the amount of time that I am spending on the work that has been provided.</td>
