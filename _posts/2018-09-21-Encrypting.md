21/9/18  Encrypting

This week in IT we started learning how to encrypt letters in more than one code rather than just moving it down two letters. We were able to change the code to make it swap the original letters to anything we wanted to. We did this by writing out the alphabet but moving the bottom letter to the top after each go. In the end I was not able to complete the work we were doing in the lesson. Some of this is from not understanding what we were being told to do and because I was probably talking to my friends too much in the lesson. Next lesson I am going to try and talk to my friends less and if I do not understand the work we have been given I will ask the teacher for some help.
